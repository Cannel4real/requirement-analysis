# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

Welcome to the *Requirement Analysis* repository.

This repository is dedicated to exploring the foundational phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): **Requirement Analysis**. It serves as a practical space to document, analyze, and model the functional and non-functional requirements for a sample Booking Management System.

By walking through real-world-inspired tasks, this project aims to:
- Strengthen understanding of requirement gathering techniques.
- Clearly define project scopes through structured documentation.
- Visualize system actors, use cases, and interactions using tools like Draw.io.
- Establish robust acceptance criteria aligned with business and user goals.

This repository is intended for learners and professionals who want to sharpen their skills in building scalable, well-defined software systems starting from a solid requirements foundation.

# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## About the Project

The **Requirement Analysis Project** focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, this project guides learners in creating a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a **Booking Management System**.

It simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining software requirements. The goal is to establish a solid base for project planning, system design, and successful execution.

## Learning Objective

This project is designed to enhance a professional developerâ€™s ability to:

* âœ… Master the principles and methodologies of Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
* âœ… Translate project needs into structured, clear documentation
* âœ… Identify and categorize **Functional** and **Non-functional Requirements** for scalable systems
* âœ… Leverage tools like **Draw\.io** to visually represent system interactions and use cases
* âœ… Establish clear **Acceptance Criteria** that align with business and user goals
* âœ… Apply best practices to produce **industry-standard documentation** and diagrams

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, and documenting the functional and non-functional requirements of a software system from stakeholders. It is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that sets the foundation for the successful design, development, and deployment of a software product.

### Why it's important:

* âœ… Defines project scope
* âœ… Prevents scope creep
* âœ… Improves communication
* âœ… Reduces development cost and time

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. **Clarity and Understanding of User Needs**
   Ensures developers build what users actually want by defining clear and actionable requirements.

2. **Reduces Risks and Costly Errors**
   Identifies conflicts or issues early in the project before development begins.

3. **Foundation for Planning and Design**
   Helps teams accurately estimate effort, timelines, and architecture.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

1. **Requirement Gathering** â€“ Collecting input from stakeholders and users
2. **Requirement Elicitation** â€“ Uncovering hidden or unclear needs using interviews, workshops, etc.
3. **Requirement Documentation** â€“ Structuring and recording all findings
4. **Requirement Analysis and Modeling** â€“ Analyzing and visualizing the requirements
5. **Requirement Validation** â€“ Reviewing and confirming with stakeholders

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements

These describe **what the system should do**.

**Examples for Booking Management System:**

* Users can register and log in
* Search for properties by location and date
* Book a property and receive email confirmation
* Hosts can add/edit listings
* Admins can verify listings and manage user reports

### Non-functional Requirements

These describe **how the system should perform**.

**Examples:**

* Response time must be under 3 seconds
* The system should support 10,000 concurrent users
* 99.9% uptime availability
* Must be mobile-friendly and browser-compatible
* All user data must be encrypted

## Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams visually represent the interactions between **actors** (users) and the **system**.

### Example Use Case Diagram (for Booking System):

![Use Case Diagram](alx-booking-uc.png)

### Key Actors:

* **Guest** â€“ search listings, book, review, pay
* **Host** â€“ create and manage listings, view bookings
* **Admin** â€“ verify listings, manage users and complaints

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria define when a feature or functionality is considered "done." They ensure a shared understanding of user needs and expected behavior.

### Example â€“ *Checkout & Payment Flow*:

* âœ… Users can review property details, booking dates, and total cost before payment
* âœ… Multiple payment options are supported (e.g., card, PayPal)
* âœ… Payment is securely processed
* âœ… Confirmation is shown after successful booking
* âœ… User receives email with booking reference
* âœ… System shows error if payment fails

---

## Tools Used

* **GitHub** â€“ Version control and documentation
* **Markdown (`README.md`)** â€“ Structured documentation
* **Draw\.io / diagrams.net** â€“ For use case diagrams
* **VS Code / Online IDEs** â€“ Optional for editing files

---

## Final Notes

This project simulates a real-world requirement analysis process. It builds strong foundational skills for:

* Technical documentation
* Stakeholder collaboration
* Requirement modeling
* Quality assurance preparation
* Professional communication in software teams

Would you like me to create this as an actual `README.md` file and upload it to GitHub with instructions on how to initialize the repo and push it?
